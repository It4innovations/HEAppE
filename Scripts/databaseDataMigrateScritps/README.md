# Migration Procedure from Version 4.2.1 to Version 4.2.2

This document describes the steps required to migrate from version 4.2.1 to version 4.2.2.

## Step 1: Data Backup

Before performing any update, it is important to back up the entire database. Perform a full database backup using the appropriate tool for your database management.

Next, you need to export the data into a format that can be imported into Hashicorp Vault. Use the script `backupDataToCsv.sh` for this purpose.

```bash
./backupDataToCsv.sh
```

This script will create a CSV format data export, which will be subsequently processed by the `importDataToVault.sh` script.

## Step 2: Migration to the New Version

After successfully backing up the data, you can proceed with the migration of HEAppE to version 4.2.2.

## Step 3: Vault Initialization && run HEAppE

Before importing data into the vault, it is necessary to initialize the vault. Use the `vaultInitToAnsibleFile.sh` script for this.

```bash
./vaultInitToAnsibleFile.sh
```

## Step 4: Import Data into the Vault

After successfully initializing the vault, you can import the data using the `importDataToVaultLockedVersion.sh` script.

```bash
./importDataToVaultLockedVersion.sh
```

The migration is now complete. It is recommended to verify that all data has been correctly imported and that the application is functioning as expected.
